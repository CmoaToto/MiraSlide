MiraSlide is a Miracast (Wireless or HDMI Display) Presentation Viewer.

The MiraSlide goal is to answer to a simple need : conference speakers are either congested or slaves of the equipment loaned, or both. Here, the Wireless Display associated with a device lighter than a computer used as remote control allow us to stream and control the slides from your phone / tablet, in addition to having in hand the additional information that can provide a computer (stopwatch, notes ...).

You can now also read your speaker's notes on the remote (your device)

You can download the application on the Android Play Store : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.cmoatoto.miraslide
